All boxes:

SSH config: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643810/how-do-i-disable-ssh-login-for-the-root-user
- No root access
- Use ssh key no password
- Change default port
- Close unnecesary ports

Redir build:

- Nginx for the service, not apache
- Nginx install and setup: https://jgefroh.medium.com/a-guide-to-using-nginx-for-static-websites-d96a9d034940
- Nginx file nginx.conf is not touched, left by default, no need to change anything
- In case the nginx redirection rules don't work, try creating a file named redirector.conf in 
/etc/nginx with th contents:

server {
	location ~ ^/w/index.php(.*)$ {
        	proxy_pass https://137.184.96.18/w/index.php$1$is_args$args;
	}

	location ~ ^/wiki(.*)$ {
	        proxy_pass https://137.184.96.18/wiki$1$is_args$args;
	}

	location ~ ^/(....)$ {
	        proxy_pass https://137.184.96.18/$1;
	}
}

In the sites-available file that you created inside that folder, the rules are inside the server{} also.
